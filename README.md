## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I took part in this challenge to familiarise myself with the basics again and relearn a few things I had forgotten whilst taking a break.

I learned more about how to effectively utilise the ':root' pseudo-class selector to save time when declaring styles for certain elements on a webpage.

```css
:root {
  --lsblue: hsl(252, 100%, 67%);
  --lrblue: hsl(241, 81%, 54%);
  --viblue: hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1);
}
```

### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects includ:

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
